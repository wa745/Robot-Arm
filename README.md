Robotic Arm â€“ Tinkercad Project

This is a simple 3D model of a robotic arm created using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/).  
The design is intended for educational purposes, prototyping, and to demonstrate the basic concept of mechanical arm movement.

Project Files:

- Main 3D model for the robotic arm.
- Snapshot of the design in Tinkercad.

Tools Used:

- (Tinkercad) for 3D modeling.
- Exported in `.STL` format for 3D printing or further editing.

How to Use:

1. Import the `.STL` file into your favorite slicer or 3D modeling software.
2. You can also modify the model further in Tinkercad or Fusion 360.
